    <!--ad reflection answer below-->
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean
        ? I think the most important terms are the body tags,heading tags,listing tags,style tags, etc i think all tags are really important
      </strong>
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?
        i think knowing you're tags is really important also knowing how to style is something important i learned this lesson
      </strong>
      <p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?
      i learned how to style it and use tags properly and i improved on using my tags where they are suppose to be etc
    </strong>
      <p><strong>In what ways do you think you need to improve?
        on learning how to style and make it looks more flashy and be able to be consistent at it </strong>
      <p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?
        i did not run into many problems but when i did i focused really hard what i was doing
        and saw what i was doing wrong over time </strong>
      <p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?
        i felt satisfied when i finished all my work and push it to github and just knowing all this work
        actually working and functioning </strong>
      <p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?
        maybe a little more style to the website not as plain but also i understand that we are barely learning
        and we will get to that part eventually but that's about it</strong>
