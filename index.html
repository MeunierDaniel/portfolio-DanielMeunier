      </strong>
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?
        i think knowing you're tags is really important also knowing how to style is something important i learned this lesson
      </strong>
      <p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?
      i learned how to style it and use tags properly and i improved on using my tags where they are suppose to be etc
    </strong>
      <p><strong>In what ways do you think you need to improve?
        on learning how to style and make it looks more flashy and be able to be consistent at it </strong>
      <p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?
        i did not run into many problems but when i did i focused really hard what i was doing
        and saw what i was doing wrong over time </strong>
      <p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?
        i felt satisfied when i finished all my work and push it to github and just knowing all this work
        actually working and functioning </strong>
      <p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?
        maybe a little more style to the website not as plain but also i understand that we are barely learning
        and we will get to that part eventually but that's about it</strong>



  <h2>Unit 2: Color</h2>
  <ol>
      <p><strong>What do you think are the most important vocabulary terms (or key concepts) in this unit? What do you think that they mean?</li>
      The most important vocabulary terms in this unit are href tag, link tag, and style tag.</strong>


          <p><strong>What do you think are the most important skills that you learned in this unit of study?
            The most important skills that I have learned in this unit is that we must be able to make title be a clickable link so that it goes to more in depth detail about a topic.</li>
          </strong>


              <p><strong>In what ways have you gotten better at this kind of work?
                I have gotten better at this kind of work because before I would think a webpage with a white background was okay but now I know how to change it to make it look better.</strong>



                  <p><strong>In what ways do you think you need to improve
                    I think I need to be more consistent with my work because sometimes I will understand the work and the other times I would be lost.</strong>




                      <p><strong>What problems did you encounter while you were working on this piece? How did you solve them?
                      The problems that I encountered were that it was hard for me add a link of an image to my title"kindergarten teacher" and "landscape architect"</strong>


                      <p><strong>What was especially satisfying to you about either the process or the finished product?
                        I am very satisfied with my work that not even if when I was a 9th grader I would have done this</strong>

                      <p><strong>If you were the teacher, what comments would you make about this piece?
                        That this piece will better for you because it will help you along the way.</strong>
